## Introduction

In this project, we explore the process of working with SQL databases, starting from table creation to data population, performing queries, and implementing triggers. SQL is a powerful language for managing and retrieving data from relational databases, and this repository serves as a practical guide for these tasks.

## Database Setup

Before getting started, ensure you have a SQL database server installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite). You can follow the installation instructions provided by the respective database system.

## Table Creation

1. Navigate to the `sql-scripts` directory.
2. Open the `create_tables.sql` script.
3. Customize the script by defining the table structure according to your project requirements. Example tables are provided in the script.
4. Execute the script to create the tables in your database.

## Data Population

1. Open the `populate_tables.sql` script in the `sql-scripts` directory.
2. Modify the script to insert sample data into the tables created earlier.
3. Execute the script to populate the tables with data.

## SQL Queries

1. Create SQL queries to retrieve, update, or delete data from the tables. Examples of common queries can be found in the `sql-queries` directory.
2. Customize the queries to suit your specific use case.
3. Execute the queries in your SQL client or environment.

## Triggers

1. Explore the `triggers` directory for examples of SQL triggers.
2. Create and customize triggers according to your requirements.
3. Implement the triggers in your database to perform actions in response to specific events.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new examples to add, please feel free to open a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue to discuss the changes beforehand.

I hope this repository helps you better understand SQL table creation, data population, querying, and triggers. Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions. Happy SQL coding!
